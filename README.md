The original preprint is available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02051

This Research is funded by IIIT Sri City, INDIA through Institute Research Grant.

cnn_vgg_faces_abrelu.m returns the Average Biased ReLU Based CNN Face Descriptor for an input image.

MatconvNet is used in this research.

The original trained VGGFace model is used and updated to the AB-ReLU based Face VGGFace descriptor by Dr. Shiv Ram Dubey, IIIT
