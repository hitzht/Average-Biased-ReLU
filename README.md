Average Biased ReLU Based CNN Descriptor for Improved Face Retrieval

%   This Research is funded by IIIT Sri City, INDIA through Institute Research Grant.
%   cnn_vgg_faces_abrelu.m returns the Average Biased ReLU Based CNN Face Descriptor for an input image.
%   The original trained VGGFace model is used and updated to the AB-ReLU based Face VGGFace descriptor by Dr. Shiv Ram Dubey, IIIT Sri City.
%   The original trained VGGFace model is available at: http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/
